# KMPTemplate

This template can be used to develop for three targets
1. Android
2. Ios
3. Desktop

This is built to reduce the effort of configuring all the targets together such as Compose for Ios which currently does not have an ios target when creating a new compose multiplatform project using intellij idea.

This is a bear minimum without networking or other things such as db. This will only provide you a basic hello world app setup.
